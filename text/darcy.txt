I have a picnic basket. Eggerton! I'm sorry, stick the beetle on who? What about flying? Blat can fly. Eggerton! Let. Her. Answer. I think we have to go with what's on the sign. That's what's in front of us, so I don't think we need to care if we're naked. We just need to worry about how we're going to get there. Yes, says that person. Now, Blat, how will you let us know that you've been murderized? That's the important part. You can use your medallion! Excellent. OK. That's what I'm saying. Ignore that part that's not on the sign. It was just what Ananka read from her point of view. Blat. Just fly up to the castle and then come back and tell us what you see. Obviously there's a door there. Remember to put your dial on your medallion to comm! Shall we walk towards him? Eggerton. Blat. Blat. Can you hear me? Blat? Blat? Argh! He didn't change the dial. I knew this would happen. Let's just go, let's go find him. And I switch to Recharge as well. I didn't hear that. Eggerton. You didn't even need a fairy cake! Why did you eat a fairy cake? Well now you seem completely out of it! Shhhhh! Eggerton! Just keep quiet! Why are you getting in a cage, Blat? Blat, what are you doing in the cage? OK, yeah, that makes sense. So we can walk in? I have this boat. I'll happily walk in, thank you. Eggerton! No! Be quiet, Eggerton! This is getting too much. We could be in big danger. Sometimes, I think it would be better if you weren't with us. Maybe they should have taken you somewhere else. I am taking your fairy cakes until further notice! We heard, Eggerton. We heard! And she drops it and kicks it a bit closer to him. All right. Fairy. Demon. Sit down and shut up. Now listen. We actually need a plan. Obviously the guards aren't going to let us out of here. Ananka isn't going to magically transport us out of here. Your fairy cakes are gone. So let's think through this. When we came in, there was someone else in here. Uh Hey. Hello. Hello? What's your name? What are you drawing? How How could they know about Steadfast? In this cell. Hello. Hello! How how long have you been in this cell? I don't know if this person is going to be much help. Does anyone have any ideas, not Eggerton Blat? What? All right, Eggerton. This doesn't seem like the worst plan in the universe. So why don't you give me the fairy cake. Uh Hello. You must be hungry! Would you like some cake? Mmmm! Num, num num. This is so good. I think it even has purply pinky sprinkles. Are you sure you don't want any of this? Yes it's good, isn't it? And they bite into it. Roll Fairy Cake, please. I don't know. This doesn't seem to be working. I can't get their attention. Fine. Did he just say "storyverse"? He definitely said "Kill them now." I heard that one. No. Just wait a minute. Hello? Ananka? Ananka? Ananka, we're stuck in this cell and this, this really creepy guy I think he called himself a Chancellor, or someone called him a Chancellor? came in and talked to us and he was really scary Ananka. I got a really bad feeling. Do you know what's going on? Do you know we can get out of this? They now want to kill us. Do you know anything about there's a person here in a cell beside us and they seem to know about Steadfast. Do you know anything about that person? So we have to get out of this cell. That seems to be apparent. That's the first problem. Do you two know what she's talking about? OK Ananka, I'm going to keep this on comm! If you have anything call me back but we need to start figuring out something right now! Blat, can you recall another bazooka? Get us out of this cell. Put the bazooka down. Blat, put the bazooka down. Hi I'm Agatha. No! I can't! Ventriloquists, actually. Do you think he's a dark Shattering-person? Well then, yes. How am I going to get the beetle on him? Then why don't you turn it to Detect? Fine, I'll turn mine to Detect. We're just practicing our act! We're so sorry, we want it to be fully polished for Your Highness. We will be with you in mere seconds. So I quickly set it back to Recharge That is an amazing sound you're doing, Phil! I don't know how you managed to project that through the whole room. I think we need to incorporate that into our act! Just just incredible. Did everyone hear that? It's simply Phil doing that noise. Isn't that incredible, everyone? Not dark magic, Your Majesty! Simply acrobatic vocal chords, if I may, that's all that is. That's all it is. Well, I think if you're going to juggle, Phil, you'll need more than one so, Eggerton, I think you'll have to pass over your ornate juggling ball as well. Eggerton! Just hand it over. A-deet deet do do doo, doot doot do do dee Whew! So sorry about that! Phil! You must try the second volley! Doot doot do do doo Ta dah! Excuse me, Your Majesty, but what are they building in the courtyard? What? But you just had something OK, OK! All right let's turn our dials to Transport and get out of here. You're really into Scribbles, huh? Maybe we should all hold onto an arm or a leg, at least have some physical contact with Scribbles. All right, everyone put it on Transport and then we'll all press the button together. Your own button, Eggerton. And hold on to Scribbles. I've got a hand. All right. On the count of three. One! Two! Three! No problem. I'm turned around. I'm turned around. Oh boy. Blat, hold up! They said this will be easy. We just have to figure out how to get to that castle, I guess, in the distance. Uh, excuse me Um What is this place? I don't think they're going to have much to contribute. Yeah. I can only speak with them! I can't do anything else. OK. OK OK. Can the fairy keep his brains? Hey, maybe they do understand. OK, wait. I just have one last question. It's got to be a good one. Um Is there a way around you to the castle? I think we're in trouble. OK, that's fine with me! I think you're right. What? Why don't you go check? Fine. Do you think Blat's OK? Blat! Do you think he's OK?! OK. Good. It's safe now! You can come down. Blat! Blat! Where are you? Are you all right? Well you got them! You did a good job! I have some bad news for you, Blat. It was incinerated along with the zombies. Yeah. But hey! Don't worry about it, you might need your wings again, really soon. So what do we think that means? I guess there's only one way to enter the castle? And it's not by foot. Well, what about flying? Blat can fly. Well Wait. Wait, remember those medallions we were given? Maybe we should try and communicate and and ask for some advice about this. Did you try using the communications button? Eggerton! Eggerton! Blat! You know that I'm meditating! What are you doing?! So? I didn't touch your shirt! Well, I think I have an idea who might have your shirt. Sorry Blat. I think you gotta face up to this sooner or later. Hello? Hello, it's the three people from the future Is that the quartermaster? What Hello, excuse me! Do you communicate? Um guys? I am, but I do not know what's going on in here. Are you going to come in? Blat, I don't get it the tendrilly thing touched me and all these memories went through my head and now look what's on the counter. It's stuff from one of my memories! What's that? See? I think it wants Eggerton. So, what do you guys think is happening here? Here! In front of you. Oh, it's the fairy cake, isn't it? Sometimes things go weird with Eggerton when he has a fairy cake. What does it want me to do with this stuff? Eggerton put the boat down. The boat's too small. You can't go sailing in it. Put it down, Eggerton. Wait, wait! Cyrus, what what's happening in here? What is this thing? What is this jelly monster? What? It is the quartermaster! Do you mean this sailboat? We're all going to die, aren't we. OK, we're done with the Snegal thing, can we move on please? Let it go, Blat. Let. It. Go. Hi. But we won't need to use Detect, because you're sending us to a place that has no Shattering today, right? I have a picnic basket. No. No. What I mean is that's all I have, is a picnic basket, and this toy boat, and you're sending us on some mission somewhere where we don't know what's going to happen, and I'm supposed to defend myself with a picnic basket? So, you're saying this should just be like a walk in the park where we could have a nice picnic, pick up some glowy device, and we're done! And we should be transported home. I don't mean to be impolite, but it seems that if you have is it Ananka? Is that correct? Right. If you have Ananka helping us, she must have some special knowledge of all this. Why can't she go into the storyverse and get the artifact? It feels like you don't even need us. Oh boy. All right, I don't think we have much choice here. Grab your extraneous items that look like they're not going to help us in the least, and let's go and do this thing they want us to do. Yes, give me the beetle. I'm sorry, stick the beetle on who? Whatever they're offering you, you have to fight it! Oh, come on! All right, if I can get you a fairy cake, will you let me go back? Well, yeah. Don't you ever die?! Rrrr rrrr! Rrrrr. Rr rrrr! Rrrr! Rrrrr. Rrr! Rrrr rr! Rrr! Rrrr! Rrr rr rrr rr! RRRRRR. Rrrr rr! Rrrrr. Rrr rrrr. RRRR! Rrr? Rrrr. Rrr rrrr! RRRRRRRR! Rrrrr. Rrr rr rr rrr! Rrr rrr rrrr rr! Rr rr! Rrr? Rrr rr rrrr! Rr rrrr! Rrrrr. Rrrr rrr! Rrrrr rrr! Rr-rrrr. Rrr rrr. Rrrrr! RRRR! Rrr? Rrrrr! Rrr hrr! Rrr hrr. Rr rrr rrrrr! Hrrr. Rrr rrrr. Rrrf? Rr hrr. Rrrr. Rrrr? Rrr hrr! Rrr rrr rr! Rrrrrr! Rrrrr. Rrrr. Rrrr rrr rr rrrr! Rrrr? Rrrrr. Rrr! Rr-rrr! Rr-rrr! Rr rrr. Rr-rrr. Rrrrrr! Rrr hrr hrr. Rrr-hrr-hrr. And I stand up so they can crawl under me. Rrr. Rrrr. Rrrr! Rr? Rrrr! Rrrr? Rrrrr. Ugh Blat, you're starting to sound a little crazy. And a little bit like Eggerton. Oh boy. I'm not sure if your fairy cakes are going to work in Limbo. Blat. Come here. Come over here. Oh, you ruined it. It's a 2. What was that? Oh boy. No. Yeah. Whoa, whoa. I think what we're on is alive. That was incredible. It looks really bad. Wait! We'll stop! We won't do any more magic! Uh, I don't know what that means. All right! Remember, I think he's a little crazy. Maybe you should have a fairy cake. Yeah. That's really terrible. No! I'm not a bear anymore. Oh boy. Yeah. To be fair, it was me. I was doing the magic. Yeah. Three hundred, actually. Um, excuse me. Do you know how we get out of here, back to the world we came from? You mean not not just the demon's? That's very frustrating. Wait! Argh I don't know, Blat. All this popping in and out of existence I don't even know what you're doing. Maybe we should just wait and this fairy can help us more. Oh. Well, that's nice to know. But what we're trying to find out is, is there a way that we can get this bounty taken off of us? Or you know, maybe grey nothingness again. There is a way to get the bounty taken off? You said yes, that that we could get this bounty taken off our heads? Well, that's the question too! No! No! Wait So hey. Could you tell us how we get out of here and how we get the bounty taken off? Okay, we'll Oh! Okay. Eggerton. Don't ask any more questions. Never mind. Excuse me. I we could just focus a minute. You said that we could follow you. You did say that. But where would you be taking I'm not sure. But where would you Where would you take us? It wouldn't be into the hands of this goddess who's offered a bounty Hmmm. I'm a little suspect now. Yeah. Ooooo. You almost flew, Eggerton! Well, now that you're friends, maybe you'd really like to help us! Eggerton can be a very good buddy. You could be Eggerton's second buddy You could be Eggerton's fourth buddy. No, he's your third. Eggerton All right. Eggerton! I never thought fairies were so traitorous! Oh boy. Why am I battling anyone? Blat. Are you okay? I'm not good, Blat. I'll take whichever one you got. Hey, guys, I can't hear you. I can't hear you. What what was in this fairy cake? Did you guys hear me? I can't hear anything. Hey what's happening? Look. Look at my arm. Look at my arm hair! Isn't it freaking you out? What is happening? Is this something to do with a whole Morrigu thing? What is going on? Where's all this wind coming from? I don't want to point out the obvious, but Blat is a living lightning rod! We've got to get away from here. I'm not going near you. Eggerton's my buddy. Buddy. Yup. No. I think we have to get out of this tree. I don't know what's going on! That little Slaad is yelling at us! Eggerton. Eggerton. Buddy. Buddy. Hey. Let's be quiet now, okay? Hi. Hi there. I'm Darcy and these are my friends. And we got in this temple through some weird reason. With the Slaad forgot about them. And we don't know what's going on. Argh! I wish that lightning would stop. Who are you? Well, I have considered that on occasion, but most of the time we decide against it. Well, he's one of our party, you see, and he's a friend, really. Blat! Stop it! Can you just move over to the other side of the room?! So I'm sorry. You deliver mail here? Thank you, Blat. Yeah, really. So I'm sorry, you deliver mail ? Oh, hold that thought. Blat, what are you doing now?! It's the black eyes, Eggerton. It's the black eyes. It's the black eyes Would you let go of my hand? What are we gonna do? Blat! Blat! Whatever they're offering you, you have to fight it! A clean shirt? Focus. Focus, you two! Don't join Morrigu! It's even a stupid name. Blat, come back to us! Blat! Tell her you don't want to see what's behind the door! Don't choose anything, Blat. Send her away! No! Eggerton! No! We don't want him making any deals with her! No deal! Blat? Eggerton? Buddy? Hello?  This is not where I was. This is so strange. Hello! Little mail guy? Hmm. All I keep seeing is that tower whichever way I turn. Who. Who said that? Oh, come on! Okay. What do you want? I didn't really think that Death was actually a guy with a scythe. I thought that was like an old wives' tale. Ohh. I don't have much to offer. I'm just a lowly person who was chosen to save the world and time and everyone in it. I mean, maybe that's worth something. Also, don't tell anyone But I can transform. Oh. Oh. Oh yeah. I see that, yeah. "Werecupine." Mmm hmm. Yeah. I mean, who knows? If there's a problem with time, that can mess with you too, right? I know, but I mean really mess with you. Like, maybe there's no death or anything anymore. Oh boy. Everyone loves those fairy cakes. All right. If I can get you a fairy cake, will you let me go back? Well, yeah. I mean, I'll get you the fairy cake first and then I'll focus on saving time. Okay. The mailman? Okay. RARRR! Fairy cakes! Fairy cakes, get me fairy cakes! Just give me give me the fairy cakes, Eggerton. Fairy cakes! I have the fairy cakes! Come and get the fairy cakes! I should eat one of these fairy cakes. Eggerton! I was dead. I'm still almost dead. I need some help. You! Were you trying to help me? Hey. You. Magnum. Magnum. Can you can you help me? I am really, really hurt here. Do you have any medicine or anything? Give me the healing potion. No. No, it's for me. Something very bad is about to happen. Give me the potion. Ohhh. That's amazing! That's really good stuff! Whoo! Fairy cakes are stupid. Didn't help me at all. Hey listen, Magna Magnus? Yeah. Heh. I'm really sorry for coming on so strong. I just I almost died, as you probably saw. So I really needed your healing potion. Sorry. Sorry about that. That's really interesting, because I was just No. Never mind. We need to get this guy another healing potion really quickly. Don't you ever die?! Do you have anything for nausea? Oh. Right. Probably just that healing potion, right? Oh, sorry. Help me! Rrrrr? Rrrr. Rrr! Rrr rrr rrrr rrr Rrrr. Rrrr. Rrrr? Rrrr! Rrr! Rrrrh. Rrr rr rrr. Rrr rr? Rrrr. Rr rrr rrrrr rr? Rrrr! Rr rrr rr? Rr rr rrrr rr rrrr? Rh rhhh! Gordo, you see me every day. Here's the name badge. Still me. Still me. Thanks, Gordo. I don't know what you're talking about. See ya, Gordo! Bye! Hey, Mr. Sootweather! How are you today? I might have stepped into it for a minute? Uh, I my hair net, see, which I have on my head now, just kind of fell into the room and I had to just grab it, but I didn't see anything Uh, I'm at the cafeteria. It's 58432. OK. Uh, I hope to see you later at the cafeteria. I know you enjoy, uh the zesty casserole! I know. I know. I know, I just OK. OK. I'm on the casserole here. Did anyone notice, do you think? Excellent. Good cover. No, it's fine. Hi. Wednesday is Surprise Day. Would you like the Mystery Flan, the Mystery Bake or the Mystery Soup? Well, it's Surprise Day. You know that's what they like to do here at the cafeteria on Wednesdays. We can't tell you, but you can have it Original or Zesty or Party. Zesty it is. Here you go. Enjoy your meal. Hail Boltius. Hey, Macey. Do you see No, not yet. No one ever takes the casserole. You know that. Do you see that minotaur sitting out in the food court? The minotaur, right over there He was right there. I could've sworn. I feel like he's watching me or something. Anyway I'm probably just imagining Yeah, I think so. Yeah, that's it I'm sure, yeah. OK. I'll be here. I'll see you tomorrow. All right. See you later. My house? Your house? Yeah. Yeah, it's just down the hallway. Nnghh! What did he mean? Why am I in here? There are no citizens in here. No citizens at all. Who's "me"? All right. Yeah, but I don't know what's going on. This only happened that Thursday that we poisoned that guy who was high up at the never mind, let's not talk about that right now. What do I do? Who are you? What's going on? Are you going to tell me what's going on here? Because I was just supposed to come into work and serve people some mystery crap, Zesty or Original or Party. And now I'm stuck in this room with a minotaur and I don't know what's going on! Where is everybody? Why is it so quiet? I don't know what that is. I don't know what's going on. Maybe we should find Gordo. Gordo might know what's going on. He runs security here. Have you met Gordo? I don't know, but I think he's usually at the back entrance and maybe we should go and look around for him or something because I don't know what's going on. Is it just everywhere, like this? Is the Emperor still alive? Hail Boltius. It's good enough for now. Well, I would go to my home but I usually get there on the tram. It's a long way to walk. Could you carry me? You seem pretty big. We might get there faster that way. Will you come with me? All right. Let's go. Okay, so here we go Mrs Sitwell? Anyone? Fine! I believe you! Everyone's gone. Where are they? What's going on? Well, this is great. Could you send the person who does know what's going on? OK. How do I know you're telling me the truth? That is true. So you need me to activate this little beetle guy? Whoa. This just none of this sounds good. What do you mean, part of me? I've never been a fan of feet blades. Is this the only way? No. Fine. Just just put it on me and you activate it. If you are screwing around with me I'm going to come back and Aagh! Hey! What theThe Oracle stopped speaking? Shouldn't you have known about this? You are going with the minotaur and leaving us? Here? Okay, I'm the new leader. Let's go. Okay, let's go. Psychosomatic. That's what it is. Let's go. What? You stole Joe's shoes? I don't know if we have time to go back and get his shoes. I think Blat should get the shoes. You're going to get distracted by raccoons again. Oh gosh. Okay, go. Go get the shoes, Blat. We'll wait here. How did you even think those were your shoes? They look like old man shoes. Oh brother. We're never going to get to this Oracle. Ah! That was quick. Your shoes are on the wrong feet. Hurry up! We have to get to this Oracle. We give you three canteens of water. You drank them in seven minutes. Gee, Blat. That's a really nice thing to say! I think we're being surrounded. did he say "carry us to the temple" or "kill us to the temple"? that doesn't sound so kind. Are we being sacrificed? This is the fastest way to get to the temple. I think we should just I kneel and put my hands behind my head. I don't know if I want to be put on a pole. Wait, I thought he just had to fight one of you. Now he has to fight all of you? Okay, Blat, we'll be over here. I think he said "Chosen". If he's the Chosen, why are you fighting him? Stop whumpa-ing. Was that acid? Okay? Eggerton! I'm impressed! That was a really good throw! Get off him! Stop it! Let go of him! I guess so? This is a very strange form of worship that's going on here. I wish I'd known this is what they meant by putting us on poles. That wasn't so bad. Well, sure. Who wouldn't have thought that? Oh, please don't. The fourth prophet? Oh, the false prophet. Thanks, Eggerton. So, hey! Don't touch the flowers. No, no! We didn't mean to insult you. So because we were roomies we get to go talk to her? I don't know, a group of robed amphibians who tried to eat your head off? Oh boy. Yes, we're right behind you. So I start down the middle aisle towards Tentatively, and as I reach the front of the room I don't really know how to approach this woman so I kind of sort of bow my head a little bit but in a really awkward way, like maybe sort of I'm being a supplicant but not doing it very well. Are you Idries? Hey! So who are you? Okay. And this is your tree? Hmm! And these are your people? Ah. So If there had been a wrongful beginning person here just as a matter of interest, what would have happened to that obviously wrongful person? Of course! The false prophet. I'm sure it's bad, Blat. What excuse me! The story of my life. So why so much interest in my friend Blat? He seems to really get a rise out of you and your compatriots here. Ahh. Well then, Blat, old buddy maybe you should come up here and do some of the talking! Really, Blat's the one who needs the favor. Oh no. Eggerton! Get up here! Just look down. No, not you. Her. Just look down. That's what that is. Darcy. Yes. We're just interested to know what happened to her. So are you holding auditions? And how's that going? I see. So you yourself do not consider yourself a prophet? Or a potential prophet? Oh. Okay. Right. So I've touched a nerve here. So hey, here's a little question: Why does everyone keep calling Blat the Chosen One? Yeah, Blat. I doubt it. Aa! Aaaa! I grab a tree root that's coming through the staircase. If he's the Chosen, why are you fighting him? And this is your tree? Ahh. So are you holding auditions? Aa! Aaaa! Ow! Blat! Eggerton! Can anybody hear me? It's oh geez. Oh Loxsyn. It's so dark down here. What are the chances of that false prophet really being down here? Uh why? Sorry, why am I battling anyone? I'm not a Chosen One or anything. Well, I can say my name I'd rather not be in battle though. It's Darcy? I'm Darcy Kimble. I just want to go back up to my friends, up the stairs?  Open the altar, open the altar, open the altar! Help! Help! Aaah! Aaa! Hurrrgh! Raaaargh! Help! Help! Somebody help me! What are you offering me? I agree. Hmmm. I can't do that. Is there another way? Yes, Blat. You did the thing. Who? We all have a bit of goo inside us, Blat. It's okay. It was surprisingly easy to do. I don't want to talk about it. Can I have one? The world has still ended. I can't believe that you've brought me to your stupid made-up world to test some sort of, what, strength or something that I have? Well, this is the best classroom ever. Ego plebium? Magic. I'm sorry. Were you waiting for me? Excuse me. Who who are you? Where is this? Okay, that's fair. Who are you? Hi Davinn, I'm Darcy. You you're my teacher? My teacher for what? OK. There was a symbol out there a symbol that I recognized from where I'm from. Do you know anything about that? Uh Not a lot. It's just something that means something to me. It helps me with something some difficulties I have. Loxsyn, yes. That's the name that's the goddess that brings me comfort. I didn't know I had to bring Loxsyn anything. Well, she's supposed to help with healing and, uh, and restoring people to their normal selves and that's important to me, because sometimes I really don't feel like myself. And she came to me at a time when I thought I was really lost and I needed her. And I'm really surprised that she's still here in your place. I thought she would only be known in Balgomar. Oh boy. Well, why are you here then? What are you supposed to teach me? Are you just supposed to make fun of me? Yeah, I think so. OK I'm supposed to go down there? OK. Fine. Do you speak to Loxsyn? Do you believe in Loxsyn? OK. I'm back. I thought that there was something at the bottom, and that's why you sent me down there. I thought perhaps I was going to meet the all-holy, all-knowing, all-seeing Loxsyn, and all would be revealed to me. But at the bottom, there was just a pool of muddy, disgusting water that was really cold. And then I just had to start climbing back up again. What kind of ridiculous test is this?! No. No. I'm tired of all the tea in this place. I've had enough tea, thank you. I want some answers. What is going on here?! What does Loxsyn mean to you? What kind of question is that? Because I thought I was going to meet her. I thought it was going to mean something. Yeah? Or I would have died down there, probably. Because that just wasn't an option! It's not an option! Because I need to know. I need to know what's going on and who Loxsyn is and what's going on with me and I need to know what you know! Yeah. Probably. OK. Thanks, I guess. OK. Yeah. I think I will. Eggerton? Eggerton. Eggerton, I'm not a bowl. Eggerton! What happened? Why are you calling me a bowl? You look like you might have had too many mushrooms or something. Okay. Blat! He's been talking to things like bowls and teacups and he thinks the mushrooms are talking to him. I feel like whenever we see Moira, bad things happen. I'm Darcy. I thought perhaps I was going to meet the all-holy, all-knowing, all-seeing Loxsyn, and all would be revealed to me. I need to know what's going on and who Loxsyn is, and I need to know what you know! Eggerton What are you doing? Could you please get some pants? Put something on. I think there's a hygiene issue here with you being in a kitchen like this. Seriously. Eggerton. Please go and get yourself pants now, or find your own pants. Yeah. Yeah. OK. No problem. I'm turned around. I'm turned around. Oh boy. Why aren't you wearing pants? I would help you look for your pouch, Eggerton and I will help you look for your pouch, but I have a real strong craving for some cheesecake. Which do you make that? Well that's perfect. That's the best kind. That's the kind I want. Sure. Sure, Eggerton, I won't be alarmed by the dancing sugar. Oh that smells so good, Eggerton. And you put in chili flakes and peppercorns! I loved that back home! Oh, that just OK, OK Oh, it's so good Eggerton. Sweet Loxsyn. Eggerton? Eggerton? Did you did you see that? Did you see the other woman who did that? Yeah, it does feel a little sore. I I'm just going to go back to my room now Oh yeah. I did say I'd help with that OK, why don't you lead the way, Eggerton, and I'll help you with that. Blat. Blat. Wake him up, you little imp. Blat! What what are you doing?! Blat. That tree is destroyed! This was a beautiful garden and you destroyed that tree. Look at all these flowers! How could you just do that?! You don't just use this Centurion weapon to take out nature and everything that's around you! You have to be more careful with it! Ananka, I don't feel like this was a successful field trip. Blat, could you please tell me what's going on? What?! Yes. What's the oracle? Question. If this house knew where to go, why did we get lost before in the desert when we were attacked by all the zombies? Where was the house then? That's great. We're the second-tier recruits. That's comforting. Blat, you can put the bazooka away now. We can't use it in close quarters anyway. Just put it away. Listen. We already left behind a crater where you destroyed the last of those zombies. Let's not make a new one here. Let's just try and relax. Ananka trusts the house. Let's trust the house. Not that I'm aware of. Ananka. I'm feeling really sick. I'm feeling chicken house sick. Can you do anything about this? And Darcy falls to the floor and just lays there gripping the floorboards. How is this supposed to help me? Okay then. All right, let's go in the direction of the chicken house. Well, that may be. Maybe it wants both. But let's just go in this direction. What is this Oracle you mentioned, Ananka? Why are we here? I'm fine with the chicken house. Let's just follow the chicken house to this oracle. Is that where we're going, Ananka? Can you put the bazooka way before it goes off and hurts someone? Fine. I'm walking behind you then. Yaaaay. Are you sure? I don't see any Oracle. I don't think there's any food. It's already out. Blat. Put the bazookas away. This might be the Oracle. Ananka? Is this the Oracle? Listen, old man. We're really tired. We've been walking for three hours no, wait! It was six hours, wasn't it. Six hours! We've been in a battle with zombies. We've been in the desert. We're thirsty, we're hungry. We don't know where we are because apparently Ananka doesn't know where we are. What's going on? Who are you and what is this place? Oh. Hi Joe, I'm Darcy. For some time it seems. If you don't run this bar any more, how do you make a living? Do you know of anyone who lives in this area? A moment please. The Oracle stopped speaking? Shouldn't you have known about this? It is his first time. Okay, I'm sorry, I can't watch this. I worked in food services. Listen, give me those. This is really unsanitary. You can't run a place like this. You need proper food, you need proper water. We've been going for a long time. Just let me deal with this and you tell us what happened to the Oracle. Yeah, absolutely. There. That'll be a silver each. Excellent. Oh, there's one now. He's gone. No Oh no. Yes. Have you noticed any unusual activity around here? Yes, or other evil presences? People with black eyes, perhaps. Have you noticed that? I'm sorry? The wha? That sounds like a good plan. I think that's a good idea. Just in case we have any other problems. So Darcy drains the tankard in front of her. And then I pick up my sleep roll and my other equipment and I march up the stairs. Blat! Blat, you should you should take this room next to me. Uh. Yeah. This one here with the green door. I think that would be a good room for you. Maybe keep your door open just in case you have a nightmare, and you need someone to come in and comfort you, you know, something like that. Okay, g'night! I get up and I peek my head out the door. We're not in the same place anymore! We've been teleported! Where are we? Where are we? Aaa! I didn't go to sleep in this room! Is there an evil breakfast being made? Where's the evil cook? Why is it so nice? It was not this nice last night. You think everything's very nice. Oh, you apologized to that zombie before you gnawed on his face. Is this Joe's place still? I hope he uses clean utensils. Eggerton, do his eyes look black. They look kind of black. Sure? Really? What is going on?! Blat, get your bazookas ready. Hello? Oh! Celene! Goddess of the moon yes. I Well, "worship" is a strong word! But I'm interested in other goddesses I'm really interested to know why you would appear here in this inn, where Joe is thirty years younger, I want to say? Excuse me, Moon Goddess? Are you trying to say that there's someone at the Oracle that you don't like, and you need help disposing of? I don't really understand all the balance stuff. We were just supposed to come here for the Oracle. Is the oracle still at the Oracle place? Oh! Well, that's good. We thought she was dead. Is that because of the Old One? Ooh. I think I'm getting this. Little bit. Little bit. So we go to the Oracle who is being kept prisoner by this Old One you're talking about? And we free the oracle. Right? Is that what you're talking about? No! Wait! But! I like chocolate! No! Blat, did you did you wake Joe? Was he up there? Wow. Well, okay, I guess he must know something then It's the minotaur! Thank you. How are you? Blat. He might be the only one who knows how to get us out of here. Just be quiet for a minute! I'm sorry. Am I understanding this correctly? You are going with the minotaur and leaving us? Here? You can't go to the Oracle alone! No one can go there alone. We don't know what waits there. He put you in a bag when he put you in this era. That's why you're here, okay? That's who the minotaur is. Gee, no pressure. Well, what do you think, Mr. Minotaur? Am I supposed to go to the Oracle? Do you know anything? Fine. Blat and I will go to the Oracle. Eggerton, are you coming to the Oracle? I don't know. She just left us here. In the middle of nowhere. With an oracle and an Old One and a Goddess of the Moon and a frog cult. And Eggerton is our leader. I don't have a good feeling about this. Okay, I'm the new leader. Let's go. What are you drawing? We’re stuck in this cell and this, this really creepy guy—I think he called himself a Chancellor? Ta dah! All right, let’s turn our dials to Transport and get out of here. It was Blat's idea. There seems to be a lot of sand Ananka. A lot. A lot of sand. I'm ready to go. I don't know what Ananka is doing. There you all are. Eggerton! What are you doing? Hello? Hello! What is going on? What am I I don't even remember coming in here! What are you doing in here? What? Why are you throwing fairy cakes at me? Uh, no, Eggerton, my eyes are not black, thanks for noticing Excuse me. Ananka, could you make any sense of this for me? Because I don't understand what the fairy is saying. Excuse me. Blat, could you please tell me what's going on? What?! Are you saying that something possessed me? I feel fine. I don't feel connected to any Shattering or Are you sure? Are you sure it wasn't just a trick of the light or something? "There you all are." Okay I don't know what's happening. Ananka, you said that you felt something? Or something's going on? Well, maybe we should get out of this place. Maybe we should head off. I don't know what direction, Ananka? Where should we go? At least it won't be here where this thing is stalking us! Second question, I'm getting pretty tired. Do you think we could stop and make camp here or somewhere close to here? Well, if we don't sleep soon I'm going to be possessed by something worse. That's That's fine with me. Eggerton is that your water rock thing making that sound? Blat! Loxsyn grant me strength. Loxsyn grant me strength. Loxsyn Bazooka! Bazooka! Bazookaaa! Ananka, I don't feel like this is a successful field trip. I feel like something went terribly, terribly wrong. And right now, I blame you. Hello? Mr. Minotaur? You’re taking me to the Academy of The Fallen? You’re—you’re from Balgomar? I don't have a home. I don't understand how you can be so positive. Did you hear anything she said? The world is ceasing to exist. But do you believe all that stuff? Do you think we're supposed to, what, save the world? You know I could actually use a fairy cake. Yeah, please. W wow. I've never actually had a fairy cake. This is This is really good. Yeah, you're do you make them yourself? I can feel that. Thank you. OK. OK, thanks. Thank you. I'm going to sleep on this side of the room. OK, you know what, I just think we just need to sleep on this, right? Because this is, this is a lot of information to take in, and uh, I'm hoping that when we wake up in the morning, none of this will have happened! And we'll have never met each other and I can just go back to ladling Impescor Zesty Golden soup to people who couldn't care less about me. OK? I do. Oh, Loxsyn preserve us. Good night. The world has still ended. Do you have any Snappies? No, no, This is toast crumbs. This is not Snappies. Snappies are this wafer-like thing where when you add water they pop and crackle, and they expand This is toast. Yes, it is. OK. They don't have Snappies. I have toast. I ladle soup for a living. That's fair. Are you experimenting on us? I wasn't told I was signing anything like that. It's fine. It's fine. The fairy. Sweet Loxsyn! What happened to you? The demon told me he wants to go next. Sounds like you did very well. Why not? They're cool. OK. Mmhmm. I'm back! I think I have to. I can't believe that you've brought me to your stupid past and trapped me in this stupid made up world to test some sort of, what, strength or something that I have? When I get out of here I'm going to take this hammer And I'm gonna picture your head and I'm gonna do this to it! You should be. You should be. You're in so much trouble, Zieffe. Nghhh! Agh! Agh! I am going to do so many horrible things to you, Zieffe! Aaaagh! What is going on?! Ugh! I hate these puzzles! Wherever your head ends up! 10. Well, if you take the hypotneski of the quorshnovati and the sningen flingen, it's going to be the 1 over the 3 or 514 And it's 324. This hurts so much. My feet! I had to walk across a bed of nails! Oh, you got some arrows. Look at my feet! Have you not got a shirt yet? I can't walk. Thank you Can any of you read your books? Well, this is the best classroom ever. Shouldn't we have a teacher? Hello, is anyone here? We're in a classroom and we don't know what we're doing. Ego plebium? I think it's a magic word. I know. But look at my books! Yes! Ego Plebium. Magic. You have to say them together, Blat. I was supposed to come into work and serve people some mystery crap and now I'm stuck in this room with a minotaur and I don't know what's going on.  Ow!  Ah, geez. Wait, where's that minotaur? Hello? Are you still here? Hello? Mr. Minotaur?  Excuse me! Excuse me, sir, can you help me? Right. I can see that. I'm really sorry to interrupt you, but it's just that I  I don't know where I am or what's happening and  And I'm wondering do you live around here? Can you tell me where I am?  What are you reading?  Actually, I don't think I need a book Well, I might look at it later  but right now, I just need your help to know where I am.  OK, So I guess Paradox is the nearest town?  I don't understand what's going on. Could you just tell me who you are and what's happening here?  Oh, no, I'm not a noble person or anything. I think you have me confused with someone else. I just need to get home.  OK.  I'm not going to any school. I don't know what you're talking about.  All right then just take me there.  Right. Maybe faster? A little faster?  This really doesn't bode well. You're taking me to the Academy of The Fallen? What about the School for The Gifted? That would be a better name.  I said uh Never mind. Is this the school?  School? OK, just just keep going!  Hi, I was I was brought here by a little guy? A halfling, I think? Hi, I'm Darcy  I'm Darcy Kimble.  Uh, thank you I don't understand  why, why do you have a file on me? I don't come from around here. I don't know you or this school.  Uhh, maybe you could tell me what's going on. Do you know the minotaur?  A hunter? He was hunting me?  There was a thing stuck through my skin, so if you call that willingly, maybe? But yeah, he sent me through some kind of I don't even know what it was.  Yeah. Yeah, I think that would be nice. Thank you.  Alright I like, I like chamomile, please. That's that's my favorite.  Oh, sorry! Oh, I think that's me. That's me, I ordered the tea.  Thank you. What's, what's your name again?  Oh, uh Thank you!  Sure.  Thank you.  Long live Boltius!  Wait, you know who Boltius is?  You're you're from Balgomar?  Oh my goodness, thank Loxsyn. Oh my gosh! So, so, so did you get here the same way I did?  No. I was  Why Do you know anything about this? Do you know why you're here?  We went back through time. That would make sense, cause when I was going through the tunnel it was like I was seeing everything all at once. Yes! Yes, we must be back in time. That makes sense!  Long live Boltius.
