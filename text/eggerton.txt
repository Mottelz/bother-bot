Hello there! Come in. Roger, over. I had a cookie but I ate it. There were some zombies but Blat blew them up and then he got cut on a tree and he has his bark in his pants. I don't really know -- MARISA (AS DARCY) *Eggerton!* What? Yep. Yep. No. You should probably go check it out. ...so it clearly indicates that we have to go inside the castle, but we can't go inside the castle through the door, or through the road, or through walking, and that kind of limits our options, and Blat's being a little weird about his wings today, I'm not too sure why, but that seems like the easy way. Maybe you could advise us, because you're our advisor and you somehow can help us with how we should go forward into this adventure -- Yes. Yes? Oh yeah. Over and out. Well, we haven't been to the door per se, but there's a sign that says, hey, don't use a door. Well, Blat took off his shirt. We're getting some conflicting information here, please hold. I also do not want to get murderized. So I don't know if that should be -- Exactly. Thank you. That's... so what I'm being told from the medallion lady is that it's a version of the story that's not -- Aack! Could you please let go of my medallion -- OK. OK. We should probably wait for him to report back to us. I think it's a nice spot though! Maybe we can take out the boat. Fine fine. OK. Uh... This is Eggerton here, uh, Medallion Lady. We are going to go forth and look for Blat. So I'm going to switch this to Recharge for a bit, because we have been warned repeatedly about that. So if you will stay tuned, we will be back with an update when an update is available to be provided to you, and we will give you the information we have at that time. OK. Over and out. OK, OK, you go first. Did... did he call me tubby? But he's such a *good* half-demon... Because I'm... I stress eat sometimes! I mean, there's all these pointy things pointing at us... *Hey guyyys!* No, shhh! Shh! Darcy, be quiet! I want a ride too! All right! We're going for a ride, Blat! Let's go for a -- I'm being quiet! *You* be quiet! I can be quiet whenever I want! Wooo! Let's go for a cage ride. We're going for a riiiide... OK, so now we're in a cage, and we're going for a ride, and I'll be back to you soon! It's OK -- I loooooove it! I looove my medallion and the lady that talks from it! I'm here! It's OK. They're asking about you. I'm telling them though that you're very nice and that everything's going to be OK. Aaaa! I can make it stop but you all need to give me my hands back from behind my back. OK so. OK, I'm going to let you go because they've got the arrows pointed at me and there's a sword in my back. So I'm going to turn this off for now but I look forward to talking with you again later. OK, over and out! Oh hi. Well, I was a little bit nervous and I heard you say that I was tubby, and when I feel bad about myself I start eating and the only thing I had to eat was a fairy cake -- OK. Oh, I'm sorry... Why... OK, I'm going to go to this corner. That's very pretty, but I'm going to go over here and, Blat? Blat, Blat, can I -- Blat, you just stand there and I'm going to come behind you. Blat? There we go. My fairy cakes... I'm sorry but they yelled at me and now I'm kind of sad. And she took my fairy cakes and I don't know how to be sad without my fairy cakes. You saw us in the jail cell? But maybe you could help us get out of the jail cell, because you've got this communicating thing, and you can see everything. So maybe you could say like, "Hey there's a weak bar in the thing and you just twist it and it opens!" Then everyone will like me again and then I'll have my fairy cakes back! We didn't get any of this training -- Oh, OK. So... I talked with Ananka and she says that she saw this, but not -- OK. Oh... OK -- But -- OK. Oh no... I still have the fairy cake in my pocket. But maybe if we give one of the fairy cake to this drawing individual, they'll be able to tell us a bit more. OK. This is a Snappie flavored one, because I remember you were sad that you couldn't have Snappies the other day, so I made it special for you and I was saving it for later -- Oh... Hey, Blat Blat, I know you're not too happy with me right now, but I had a question for you. If you don't mind, I'd like to ask you that question, but I don't want to get yelled at again. So you know how sometimes when there's zombies or flowers or trees, and you say "Bazooka!" And then a bazooka appears... Could you maybe be like "Key!" And a key would appear? Or like, "Bolt cutters!" Or something like that? OK. Hi I'm Eggerton -- We have these neat little things and they can turn them and then -- I don't want to be killed now. OK, I'm against the wall. I thought you said that you could take the thing out and then we could use it to bang down the door. Uh... What's a shell? I have a question. Did anyone check to see if it was locked. OK. Just wanted to make sure. I think he means the sign. Can I have my fairy cakes back -- Give 'em. Blat, they ate fourteen and a half fairy cakes. And that's too many fairy cakes for that many people who have never had them before -- What? One knee? OK... I get down on one knee. No fairy cakes. OK. Hey guys, there's there's a thing on the amulets, remember? We can detect! We can detect if something's with the Shattering. But mine's out of power, because I was talking with the nice lady. What? It's dead. Woo! Thank you. Oh yes, my *ornate juggling ball* that I have as part of our ventriloquist act, because that's who we are! We're ventriloquists... OK, OK, here you go. Yeah, it's not like we're some kind of lame improv troupe or something. I am not a fan of apples so I'm going to go stand over here and work on my ventriloquism. We're ventriloquists now! We are near a tree and it's got apples on it and in my experience apples can be rude and bullies so I'm going to stay away. But they're talking with the king because there was a riddle and we knew the answer and then the chancellor had black eyes and we put one of the devices on him and then he went away and there was a little song and dance and this one guy really liked it. And there was a flower they were building that looked like Steadfast but now they're not going to make it anymore. And the slaves, they're not going to be slaves anymore because the king seems like a kind of OK guy, but now he's over by the apples and I don't like apples. So I thought I'd call and say hi. How are you? So, about the artifact... What what exactly are we talking about? Aww, geez. Yep, I'm here! OK. But did you know there's a there's a big thing up there? Did you see him? OK, OK, I just wanted to make sure we all knew... I... I have questions for you, Blat, that perhaps you can answer. Um, why was there a giant head eating fairy cakes and why did he have a ball? And why was the King playing with a ball in the tree while thinking about a lover? OK. OK. We're all going to push one button together? Or we're all going to push -- I'm going to push my own button. OK, I've got a foot. I knew we were friends! We will do a *spicy* fairy cake! I make the best pleather cheesecake in all of Balgoria. Could you turn around please? Are you turned around? Are you turned around? OK, I'm going to bend over to pick them up, don't look over. ...Oh geez. You think they want a fairy cookie? I would like to keep my brains please. Ms. Darcy, could we keep my brains? Well, could you maybe ask them if they would prefer someone else's brains over mine? I'm going to climb a tree. I think he got 'em. You should go check. Because I'm above you on the tree. All right. What? I'm sure he's fine. OK. Blat. Blat! So when you kill undead, do they die or do they come back to life? I don't really understand how that would work. "One must arrive." "Neither by horse or by foot..." "Neither by road or by path..." "If this person comes..." "...the kingdom will be saved." "If not, we shall..." I don't like this sign. Pamir, Pamir. Do you know a King Pamir? Maybe you read some extra briefing papers, I dunno. Or on the road that leads to the castle. Blat, can we get on your back and fly? You should probably go check it out. OK. OK, I'm going to try first. I'm going to try first. Hello? Hello... Hello...? Mine's broken. Oh no, yeah, I knew about the button. I was gonna try and do it the hard way though, because you know... I wanted to save the buttons for later. So I'll do the button now. Hello there. Hello. Hello. Come in. Roger, over. Hello. Hello. Hi. Ooo! How are you? Yes, it is me. How are you? Oh, I'm not too bad. There were some zombies but Blat blew them up and then he got cut on a tree and he has bark in his pants. I don't really know why --  -- what? What? What? Yep. Yep. No. We may have a situation here... Anaka. I am being given looks to report to you accurately what has happened and transpired, so from the beginning... We came here. My tummy was a little upset, I climbed a tree... Uh yeah, no, OK. And then I... Blat doesn't have a shirt on, and he's got abs, did you know he has abs? And then, we are at a castle and there's a sign and the sign says some things about getting into the castle. Uh, there were zombies but the zombies are blown up now, I think, I really -- Oh yeah, so uh, the sign says... I don't hink she han hear oo... My bed's right here next to yours... Is it the one you're wearing? Because you're wearing that one, if you're looking for it. Yeah, and I'm wearing one of them. Is that the one you're looking for? I've got an extra one if you need it. It might be a little small on you. I don't know why you really want to wear one of mine then. It doesn't make that much sense. Go to the door... OK! I can do that for you. OK. OK. I was not supposed to tell you that Blat was in here, but I'm pretty sure he's more interested in getting his shirt back and now that you found his shirt for him, why don't you come in? He's hiding under his cot -- Oh jeez, that looks like it hurt -- OK! OK, I'll help you with that. That's OK. We can fix it. OK. So... Blat! Blat, come out from under the bed. We found your shirt. We found it, Blat. I know -- We have your shirt! What is the Friend Song? How does it go? I'm not sure, but I'm going to wait outside here, and you can let me know. Are you still alive? Uh... Blat's coming in! What, what, what are you doing? I don't want to be beholdered! What? You had sex with Snegal? But why would you say that -- Ooo, a fairy cake. Where? Where? Who? Look at this brochure... It wants you to go sailing. Let's go sailing in this boat! OK, I'm going to take the boat and go sailing. But it's so pretty. Cyrus, we're going to go sailing in this boat. You should come with us, it's going to be a lot of fun. I had a cookie, but I ate it. Why did you have sex with an imp? But you say that, and it makes me think that you probably did have sex with an imp. OK, everybody in the boat, I'll drive. We we were there. Yes. Hello. I like your shoes. Yay, cadets! I'm so happy to be a cadet. I wish I could write to my friends back in Balgomar and let them know that I'm a cadet now. It's a pretty neat promotion. I was never a cadet before. I'm quite pleased to have a title like this -- Can I have a straw for my iced tea? Uhh... what's a storyverse? This one looks nice. I like shiny things. Thank you. Where do they go? Oh... OK. Hey Blat, want to bring an extra shirt just in case? I don't know if you noticed, but this door doesn't actually go anywhere, so maybe we should try one that goes -- Aaaaa! Buddy? She said "Oh jeez." Rrrrr. I agree, this is definitely very unusual. I'm not entirely sure what we should be doing here. Well, I guess we should start walking in a direction, because we have not been prompted with any other information that could help tell the story at this point. Oh -- well, I was thinking we'd go the other way. Well, it just seems like the natural choice. I mean, if you were to sit down and say, this direction is one way, and that direction is the second way, and then bounce back and forth with some kind of limerick or song in your head, you would probably land on this direction. Yeah, you've heard of it! Yeah, but I mostly prefer to use apples and pears -- it doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Okay let's just go in this direction. What's what? Where? The brush rustled? Uh-oh. Oh! She says she can smell Blat. We should probably follow her. Plus she's, you know, a giant grizzly bear. Onward! It wasn't me. Don't look at me! Oh, no, sorry, I thought you said something else. She says that she lost the trail of Blat, but she picked up our trail again. Which doesn't really make sense, because we would have kept going the same direction that would make this a very, very small area for us to have wrapped around the whole way. So what's probably happening is some kind of shift in the wind, which means our scents are being thrown ahead of us somehow, and confusing her bear mind. Yes, that is also possible. But I think my theory of shifting wind patterns and, you know, the changing climates of this land probably have more to do with it. Oh yeah, sorry. Well, it's a nice-looking nose, yeah. But it's still *big.* Rrrr rr! Okay. Okay, fine. With your *average-size* grizzly bear nose that performs adequately under pressure. Okay, just stop looking at her nose and let's go. Okay! It's okay. It's okay. It's just -- let's go. Let's not talk about it any more. It seems to me, as the leader of our group, that -- It seems to me that, as the leader of our group -- Yes -- that something weird is happening here, and we should probably, you know, figure out why that weird thing is happening. And then we can maybe find a solution to that weird thing happening. And then we can find Blat and then we can go home. Okay, as the leader I endorse this action. Thank you, Advisor Number 2. Okay, wait, wait, wait, here we come, here we come. That was an excellent expression of rage, Bearcy. And it reflects how all of us feel. So. What I can understand at this point is, we've all lost our minds collectively. And that's it's... not good. Okay. You go first. Okay, go. Okay, I'm waiting for you to step into the woods. I'm seeing you -- you're walking, but you're not in the woods yet... Okay. Let us know what you see once you get a little further -- Was it a rustling brush? Yeah. Okay. You keep going and report back... Recon Team Alpha. What, don't -- stop pushing me! Stop pushing me! Fine. Okay, we're coming, we're coming. I don't know where he went. Okay. So *I* was not the one who said we wouldn't go into the woods after him. It's okay. We'll find him. We'll find him. He's... Okay, okay, okay -- Yeah, we're coming! Where are you? We are also right here! Where are you? Is it this tree? We're next to some trees! Well, it's kind of brown. It's got some leaves on it. Yeah. Yeah, it's the same tree I'm looking at. I can't see you. Okay, no, I went to the other side of the tree. I thought I was going to the other side of the tree and you were staying. Okay, I'll stay where I am and -- Okay. Okay. Okay. I went to the left. Did you come to the right? Okay. Wait, where's Darcy? Darcy, where are you? Yeah. Okay. No. So I'm on the left side of the tree. Magnus is on the right side of the tree. Which side of the tree are you on? Okay. My tree is shaking. Okay. Okay. The tree's got pine needles falling off of it now, right? Yeah, okay. Do you see that, Magnus? Okay. So we all agree that the tree in front of us is shaking, pine needles are falling off of it; smells faintly of blueberries and salmon on the one side of the tree. Yeah. So, what exactly is happening in that we are all around the same tree but we're not around the same tree? Exactly. It doesn't make sense. Now, the only thing that's changed, to my knowledge, is that this young man here, who claims to be a monk, has arrived. I wonder how much he might have to do with this weirdness. Me too. Oh! I saw a thing! I saw -- I think there's a thing. I gotta go. Okay. Everybody follow me. Follow my voice, then. I'll find a way to talk more so you can hear me as I go. Okay guys, so there's somebody that went past me and there was a giggle or something, I don't know what that was about... Oh! There's another giggle. We're shifting! 14 degrees starboard! Yeah. It's nautical. I think that as you age you will mature and learn about new things... Well, that's the direction it went in and that's the direction we're going now. Okay. It's okay. Yeah. So we're going to keep going in this direction. Do you guys see that? There's a fairy! And it's flying. I didn't know fairies could do that. What! She just stuck her tongue out at me. Okay, I'm going, I'm going! Let's go! Up to 15 knots! Let's move. There's a fairy, guys! We're gonna get the fairy! Come with me. It's okay. We'll get it! We'll get it! Ohh. Hey guys! I told you I'd get us out of the woods. Well, once you've seen one glade, you've kind of seen all the glades, I think. But I feel that every experience we have can be seen as unique, no matter what. So if we keep that in mind, and with a positive attitude, this glade maybe is a different glade... and we'll be okay. Okay. No need for that kind of foul language, Darcy. Okay. So I saw a fairy and it was flying around -- What? What? Look, there she is! There's the fairy. I found the fairy. But... no, I'm a fairy too. But you're like a *fairy* fairy, fairy. Okay, "fairy fairy fairy fairy fairy" is not something that we talk about around other people. Did you see the *attitude?* Who's "she"? Stephanie? I knew a Stephanie once. No? Not Stephanie? Are you a good fairy? Fairly. Stephanie. Oh, sorry, sorry. I'm being told it's Suzanne. Oh no. Cel -- Okay. Yeah. We should probably get under Darcy. She'll keep us dry. Don't put that there! Oh sorry. That was my toe. Sorry. Sorry. I think I'm allergic to bear. Oh, I wouldn't say that to her when she has the potential to roll and crush us. Okay. Okay. Sound machine! Wha --? What happened to my pillow? I... had a body pillow. Oh sorry, that was your leg. I'll wipe that off. Yay! Awww. Yay! Okay, Blat, you look kind of tired and beat up. Why don't you have a fairy cake, and we'll sit, and we'll have a little talk, and we'll figure all of this out. Okay? As the leader of the group -- It's my responsibility to make sure that you're you're on the up and up. Okay. But I think because there's fairies around we're probably in like a fae-related place, where the fairy cakes may have more potency. Okay, Blat, I think it's really nice that she did her bit of trickery there, but come on, have a fairy cake. It'll give you some pep. It'll bring your focus in. We'll be able to move forward. All right. Here you go. This is a nice special purple swirly. Have that. I told you that the fairy cakes worked. That -- that -- that was it -- no. I... Okay. Did anyone else have a fairy cake? So the ground's actually moving. I'm going, I'm going! No, no, that wasn't -- that wasn't me... No, it was her! It was her. Aaa!  Dive roll! *Aaaaaa!* Okay. I don't want to look at it. How bad does it look? I don't want to look. Oh, it hurts. Why are you smiling? You're smiling! I can see your teeth. Why are you smiling? It hurts so much... Don't let him fall on your leg. Okay... This is... interesting. I thought there'd be, I dunno, some art or... Who's Jerry? So can we do something about my leg that's crushed? 'Cause it kind of hurts and it's floppy. Oh, that's a good idea. I'll see if the fairy cake helps. Okay, I'm gonna try a fairy cake. Oh... it's okay. It's a little sore. Hey, Darcy, do you think you could carry me for a bit? Well. We all are a little bear inside. There they are again! It's that fairy. What are you doing here? Well, I -- No, I didn't -- I didn't do the magic! Darcy did magic. What was that thing in the valley, in the glade? The glade. What was the... the big stone thing that tried to eat us? Oh, I see, it was the glade. I wonder if there is some kind of list somewhere operated by someone that has all this information. There was a joke in there and it didn't come out. Okay, okay here we go. Oh! Yeah! Hey. How much? So what kind of mail were you delivering? Who's chasing you? Oh, wait. Did you leave a fairy cake trail? What? Like what? Oh, here. Have one of mine. Yeah, this is a homemade recipe. What are you talking about? It's a purple swirly! This is classic! You should eat it. It was applesauce. There was this one apple that kept talking back and I had to... Oh. Oh, yeah. Ohhh. Yeah, that would be a good idea. Oh, may not have been up to your standards, but this is a pretty good fairy cake overall. I am starting to think that they may not be a good fairy. I mean, on top of the delivering us to the -- Oh, you want to have a fairly fairy-off? Yeah? You want to go far away and have a fairly fairy-off? Let's go. ...I can't fly. I've never been... Now I feel kind of guilty about -- I've been eating a lot of fairy cakes. Okay, I'll try one of your fairy cakes. Thanks. That's... that's interesting. It's very tasty. And -- what? What...? Oh! I almost... How did that happen? Yeah. Well, I already have a buddy. Darcy's my buddy. That was already decided before. Well, I kind of like to think of Blat as my second buddy. Well, actually, I think that's Magnus here -- No, my third buddy is the mixing bowl back in the kitchen. Okay. Yeah, let's walk this way. Yep. *Rowr!* The High Priestess was ready to lean over and suck your soul or something. And Darcy grabbed a quill and just jammed through her eye. All right. I've got a blue polka dot one for you. Here, Blat. That'll be good. I think it's got a bit of peppercorn in it. Oh and Darcy, I've got a purple swirly. I know you've always admired those. All right. And then I'm gonna have this triangular one that I was experimenting with. How did you make it triangular? That is a 7. 2. That is including the +Wisdom. You guys feeling better now? What? What? Why aren't you talking? Why is your mouth moving like that with no words. Why aren't you reacting to no words coming out of your mouth? That would make me kind of panicked. I don't know -- I'd feel bad about that. I'd be worried. This is an unusual sensation. Blat? Blat? Hey, Blat. Blat. Where are you going? Maybe this is what happens when you have a triangular fairy cake. It's an unexpected side effect that has turned everybody's hair sentient. Ouch! What? Did you say pleather? What guy? Okay! Okay, buddy. We're buddies. Does this mean that we get to share stuff? Because you've got a sweater that I saw you wearing back at the Academy -- Oh. Okay. Hey, Blat, could you maybe stop? I just think the Slaad are getting scared, and you know they look like they get scared easily. I don't want them to be scared. Hey buddy -- buddy, you need to hold my hand. It's really sad when they say "Bye-bye" and I'd prefer if they could stop doing that, so if you could stop with the whole weather, and the cyclone, and the lightning, and the tree falling down, I'd really appreciate it. He's got a really short arms for a Slaad. Hi, I'm Eggerton. It's nice to meet you. We're here on an adventure -- we came to see the Oracle but don't think the Oracle is here anymore. And then Blat started talking kind of funny in this weird *BAHR BAR BAHR* voice. And then I kind of turned into a bear. It was pretty cool. I was pretty tough. And -- What? What? Yeah? Hey buddy. Okay. I don't know why you didn't do that before. It got kind of inconvenient for a bit there. Blat could fly. Remember he flew when -- What? What? Black eyes! Black eyes! Oh geez. Okay, but I'll just.... Okay, I'll hold your other hand. Blat! A really interesting filing system? Wait, so it's a cake that eats itself? Oh sorry, okay, yeah. Ask for Door Number 2. There's always a better prize behind the second door. Door Number 2! What? What? Oh. No deal. No deal! I would say that in the case of this deal, you should say "No deal.". Door Number 2 is always a better choice. Buddy? I'm on it! I'm on it! Okay, here you go. Here, take all the fairy cakes. The fairy cakes are yours, buddy. Yeah, I gave them to you. But I just gave them to you. What? Okay, well, you probably, you know, took too many at once. I've always told you to just take a little bit at a time. It probably canceled itself out when you took two. Okay okay okay... It's an interesting idea, having it in liquid form. It probably doesn't taste as good as fairy cake. Just... you know, if you want to try a fairy cake. Do you want to try a fairy cake? No, this is a tasty fairy cake! Watch. Something's wrong with the fairy cakes... what did... It was the lightning! The lightning did something to the fairy cakes. Oh no. Give me the pouch! Give me the pouch! Okay. I think these are okay now. I went through all of them. Here, you can have one of these fairy cakes. This is a purple swirly, it's kind of my thing. People really like it... So you can put that in your pouch. There you go. And now, when you eat that, only eat half, wait twenty minutes and see how you feel. If you feel like you need more, then take more, but know that sometimes it can take you a little further than you think it'll take you. It's not medicine, it's a fairy cake. It hurts! Aaaaaa -- Watch out for Bearcy! Do you need a fairy cake? Okay. Here you go. But there's something wrong with them. I think maybe it's the evil magic... What? Oh no. What's that voice? Do you hear the voice? What is it, though? I think Bearcy hears it too. Do you hear the singing? No, it's singing, it's... Yeah, Bearcy, I can hear it too! Yeah, but I learned that I can talk to all of the animals, so I understand exactly what she is saying. Yes, but now she's in bear form, so she's speaking like a bear. And I understand the -- Did you not get this in your training? Because this was covered in my training. See? She's saying that everything's gonna be okay and you should calm down. And also you should be nicer to me, she said, and probably, you know, lend me some extra shirts sometime or maybe a few credits if I need it, because I run out of supplies and I forget about them. It is a lovely hue of blue. That's exactly what Bearcy just said, Blat. You should really try and listen. It's kind of rude. She says hello. See, Blat? It's just you. I don't know why -- Did you eat the fairy cake at the whole time, like all at once? I told you not to do that. Well, there's just a little bit of Morrigu on them. Oh, it's okay. I'll get him for you. It's OK. She wants to say hello to you. There you go! Come on over buddy. That's it. Let's meet Celene. Why are your eyes closed? Um, yeah. Well, Blat, why don't we use your shirt? I mean you've got a lot of them. And I'm sure -- I had some water but something happened to it. Depends on whose version of events that you listened to, yes. Okay. Here... All right. Here you go, sir. Just put your hand out, and now, okay. Now, eat half, don't eat the whole thing -- See, that's how they're *supposed* to work. I could be a god. That's what she said! Blat, seriously, she's just saying Loxsyn is a wonderful goddess, who is all about peace and love -- -- and might be a good fit here. I don't know why you just don't *listen.* Yes. And she just explained herself very clearly. It's a celebration now? The large explosion at the center of Steadfast was a celebration. I have charts on how the wind will expel any potential harmful chemicals away from Steadfast, though. It's OK, everything's OK. I'm OK. This is OK. It's good. We're good. OK. I had eight minutes, I thought. OK. So you go talk to Karen. I am going to rearrange these fairy snacks that I brought in from home. And I'm not going to eat any of them. I am not stressed out at all. I will not resolve it with eating fairy snacks... What celebration are we celebrating? That's my presentation, right. Right. Right. And today's... it's Tuesday. It's Tuesday. OK. No, that's good. OK. Oh it's ok... Yeah, go, go. I'm good. I'm good. I got it. Good good. Oh geez. It's OK though. I know because it's Tuesday and Tuesdays are always good days for me. I like Tuesday. I found that microcredit on the ground last Tuesday so this Tuesday's *gotta* be good. It's OK. It's OK. I'll get it. I'll get it. Good good good. Hmm... I've got it! Right! Everybody have a fairy cake! I brought them in from home. I made them myself. They're very tasty. I had to... to make sure they were very tasty, though, for all of you. Yes! A celebration. That is exactly what I had planned on doing... and I have done that. So let's get started with the presentation. It's good. It's good! Uh... could someone pass me one of the cakes, please. OK, thank you. Thank you for that. Yes yes. So, we need to say that this Extremely Devastating Explosion was in fact a good thing. It's good, it's good. So what we need to do is *spin* the idea into something good. So what I thought we could do is say that this Extremely Devastating Explosion was in fact a celebration from the *previous* Extremely Devastating Explosion, and that *the smoke always clears.* See, it cleared! So we're all good and we were just having fun, because we all like to have fun! And the other thing I thought we could do then is put... Yes, that is what I said. Well, thank you very much, Karen. The next slide. Right right. The slides are all... they're all good. So... Flashmob! That was weird. So we got everyone together, and we got on the Speechifyer, you know, the night before the celebration of the Extremely Dangerous Explosion or, excuse me, Devastating Explosion. And we told them, "Hey everybody, here's a fun idea. Let's re-enact the first one and then after that we all jump up and go 'Hooray, we're alive!' And we took this picture to show, for you know, prosperity what it would look like before that happened. That's going to be really good because we'll get the students out. Maybe we'll bring up some of the people who are working in the basement, they don't see a lot of the sun. So I think, you know... we can all get behind this, right? ...Right? ...I didn't think it was that bad. Well, I knew Karen was a little, you know, unhappy with some of the things I had done but I didn't think they'd all run away. I do get pretty excited from time to time and when I get wrapped up in an idea that idea just starts going and I don't really know how to stop those ideas from going and it's sometimes good though. I think it really helps me get new ideas and that's what I like to do when I'm making the fairy cakes, I'm trying different shapes and different colours. So I don't know that I'd necessarily see anything passing me by. But at the same time you know I was thinking really really hard and that could take away from it too. But you know Karen, she wears those shoes and they *clip-clop, clip-clop, clip-clop* when she walks in, so I don't really know... And I'm really just trying to figure out you know, should I be doing this job or should I be trying to do something different? I think I can probably, you know, make people happy. And no one ever really seems... What was that? It smells kind of funny. Whaaa... Hi, Chicken Hut! Let's go forth, Teeeam Fairy! I think there's something in my shoe. Like a stone or something? I dunno, it's kind of pokey. Everybody! Hold party! Shoe inspection. Oh, no, it's all good. Shoe back on. Let's move forward, party. No, it's still -- there's still something pokey! I don't... Okay, everyone hold. Wait a second. Take my shoe off... this time I'll take my sock off... Nope, there's nothing there. I don't get it. Oh well. Party forward! Now my other foot hurts. No, no I'm sure it's fine. I'm sure it's nothing. You know what, I think we probably should, though, because it'll bother me if I don't check it and it turns out to be something. I mean you don't want to get a little infection the bottom of your foot when you're walking for a long time, then it'll slow everyone down later, so it's probably better time management-wise if we stop now and I take a look. Okay, okay. Party hold! No, there's nothing in there! That's so funny! I guess... maybe it's -- what is it when you *think* there's something wrong and then -- Yeah! Psychosomatic stone in my shoe. Yep. Psychosomatic stone in my shoe. PSS. Okay, okay. Here we go! Party forward! Oh. Wait. You know these *aren't* my shoes. Yeah, no. My shoes are a different colour than this. These aren't my shoes. I think you're... well, okay. We'll all head back. We should all head back actually, and I'll change them out for my shoes and then we can get going again. It won't take that long. I didn't steal Joe's shoes! I just put on a pair of shoes that were next to where my shoes were and they kind of fit. Look, we've only been on the road for like a minute and a half. We've got a long way to go. Let's just head back, get the shoes and then we can go again. I'm not going to get distracted by -- there's a raccoon? Where's the raccoon? I never got to talk to the raccoon... So how are you doing, Darcy? Yeah, but I never look down a lot, and when I look down, I can't always see my shoes, because I've got a bit of a belly and... I'm sure we'll get there. Okay. Oh! How is Roderick? Okay, okay, no, we've got to put the new shoes on. Hold on. Let me sit, get these off... put these back on... wiggle around. Okay, that's better! Can you take Joe's shoes back? Well, that was kind of rude. Well, what's Joe going to walk around in now? What... what does that mean? I mean, he was very up and moving around... Okay, party hold! Guys, wait uuup! It's been too long and my legs hurt and you won't let me eat a fairy cake. It's just so hot outside, and I didn't bring any extra water and you won't let me eat the fairy cakes and... just maybe a little bit and it'll give me a pop so I can keep going? Yeah, but -- Well, you don't need water, Blat! You'll just turn it into steam, right? I heard "gill us to the temple". That's very nice of them. I was a little afraid at first but they seem quite kind. Is there going to be snacks? Okay. Sir? Sir. Faphth? Fath. I don't like this. I don't want to be poled. Okay, I'm going to go over here and hide behind this rock. Darcy, quick! Over here. Go team Blat! Did he say "Chosen"? Woompa, woompa! Uh... woompa... Blat, get up! I'm distracting them for you! *Woompa!* Oh, sorry. I think so. He looks pretty hurt. Wait, wait! I have an idea. *Blat! Open wide!* So am I! I don't know what happened! I -- I -- I didn't enter... I did not actually enter... I stayed back. I -- okay, I... all right... Yes! I jog back over, out of breath and a little dazed. Well, I guess they just recognized how important I am, and decided to go through with it. Now, everyone stand back. I'm going to use a little bit of my PR charm to convince them to help us find Idries. Slaad! Thank you for bringing us to this majestic place on this noble quest of ours to find Idries. If you would please regale us with the lore you have learned of Idries so we can go forth and rescue all of time, it would be much appreciated. Thank you. You are now in awe. Oh, that's... Okay, so maybe we could speak with Idries the *true* prophet, her sister... Oh yeah, that's... I, uh, so... yes, that is what I said. And I think maybe it would be best if Darcy... ...you were to take the lead in this case now. I have prepared the crowd for you. I've warmed them up and they're all yours to go. And I'm going to be over here and... oh look! There are some flowers over there. And I wander off to look at the flowers. Oh! Okay... I'll stay here. They are particular about their geraniums. Yes, let's go. Uh, excuse me, everyone... Is there a restroom in the tree? I had a bit of water earlier, and then there was a lot of running, and we were carried and it was a bouncy trail... I need to go and I don't want to be rude but this is a tree -- I figured, you know, if you can't find a restroom you can *use* a tree... But we're inside a tree and -- what? What? Hello! I'm looking for a restroom... Oh sorry. Oh. Uh, yes. I'm just... you know, I can just pick a corner -- I'm comfortable doing that. This is a tree. So that's what we used to do, you know, when we couldn't find a -- Excellent. Thanks so much! Hey guys! You have got to check the bathrooms in this place. It's like these little notches in the tree -- Gooo Team Blat! Okay, Blat, you sit down and close your robe again please. No, okay, stop... That's the half demon. So you just... you tuck that back into its flap and close your robe, and I'll go get you some scones. You sit here and talk with Rando about what happened next. I think the tree was hungry. I'm sure she's going to be okay. Darcy always perseveres. Well, that's very nice of you to say. I've always thought there was something a little more special about me than the others. But no one ever really wants -- I don't need to go -- okayyy. I'll be back... Oh! I've been trying to tell you I don't need to pee again. Thank you for listening. Uh, I'm going to head on back and see what Blat is up to. So thanks very much for the lift... and I'll see you soon. Wumpa wumpa. Wumpa. Wumpa. Chosen One... One who is chosen. Wumpa. Wumpa wumpa? Uhhhhhh... I, um... Uh, Blat, Blat, hey Blat, I have a couple questions for you buddy. So, when did you learn to talk like that? Because it was kind of creepy, I mean I know we joked about about being ventriloquists a while ago, but that was going a little too far, I think it really kind of ruined the mood here, and... Yes -- Oh, that sounds like Darcy. We should probably go take care of that right now. Okay... All right. Okay. Okay. Blat, I think maybe that you should use your newly-found prophesizing to tell all of the Slaad to help us. Or maybe, you know, do you have powers? Did you get powers? Oh! I've got an idea. I've got an idea. Blat! Okay, here's what we're going to do. You, think about moving the altar. Okay? Think about it. Are you thinking about it? Think about it. Close your eyes. Think about it. Thiiink about it. Think about it. Well, I didn't do it in front of the Slaad... but I thought, you know, if you were thinking about it and then you got really *angry,* that would be the burst you need to make it move. Yes, exactly! I think that is a very clear solution we should be exploring. See? It's starting to work. I... actually, I think it might end badly for you, that's what it sounds like to me -- What? The little... who's the little one? I don't... The Slaad all look roughly the same size to me. Okay, so... where's the little one? Okay. All right. Okay. Aaaa! I'm okay over here! I landed on a couple of... We landed on a couple of the Slaad. They broke my fall. No! You're not supposed to fight me any more. The lightning, the tree, everything -- No, okay -- I'll say it! Bazooka! Bazooka! Come on, bazooka! Bazooooka! I don't like that. I don't like it. Bazooka! Bazooka! Blat! Hey, Blat... Aaaa! It's a 9. Blat! I don't want to fight him, Blat! Blat, If you call... I don't know, though, because then we might explode again and I didn't like exploding but I also don't want to fight him, Blat. I don't wanna fight, Blat! Blat, please don't make me fight! No, it's okay! I've got an idea. I've got an idea! I'm gonna... uh... uh... I don't have an idea. You guys see how pretty it is outside, though? I have a question! There's no such thing as a magic word. ...Oh dear. Tingly! I wonder why I can smell like a squirrel right now. And why there's a bunny rabbit over there and what that flower is looking at. Is it looking at the bunny rabbit or is the... Oh! Oh no. The bunny is coming over to the flower. No, bunny. No! No, I like that flower! Oh geez. Oh gee. They have fairy dust? I've never even seen fairy dust before. I'd only heard about it. Wonder if I could use it in some cakes? Maybe I'll just take a little bit, put in my pouch for later. I feel... conflicted about making anything with you now... chrysanthenums! OK, maybe I'll... make, uh, some fairy cakes. Most... tubular, I hear. So, I... I'll just go over here and look for some Impescor sugar while you hang out over there, chrysantheyums. 103 types of sugar! Which one is Impescor? That's very strange. So, I don't mean to be rude, Mixing Bowl, but is it perhaps possible that I had some *bad* fairy cakes prior to this little adventure, and that is why you and the Chrysantheyum and the apple -- the one apple, he looks kind of angry but he's an apple -- why they're talking, because I don't ever remember these things talking before but... OK, Apple, just, you know. That's OK. I'll consider that for next time, but I'm, uh wondering why, perhaps, anyone can tell me why all of you are talking, because I don't remember foods talking before and it's kind of neat, it's nice, it's like hey, we're having a kitchen party, but at the same time I need to chop you up and mix you, and I'm having mixed feelings about that. You *say* you're okay with it -- Um... This is a lot of fun, everybody! Thanks for helping me out... But I was wondering if perhaps one of you wanted to elect maybe, you know, a leader among you who could guide me spiritually through this process, like I'm sure in other processes happens that are less confusing. All right, so that was... fun. Maybe you know I should go though and have a nap and try and recover, because you knowthis ... it's been a lot of baking. We've had a lot of dancing, it's been a lot of fun. But you know, you need to take a break, so you know when you're *having* fun. That sounds lovely, but I'm not sure that I'll be able to get too much sleep with everyone singing and dancing. Why is that carrot so noisy? It keeps coming in. I think... there might be something wrong with this kitchen. Thank you Mr. Mixing Bowl. It's nice to see you again. When did I fall asleep? I will never... forget what I learned here today, let me be certain of that in my telling you things. Now, if I were to try and leave this place where might I go? Oh, that's nice. But, I'd like to go there. I'm just wondering because I was outside and then I looked into the crack and then I was in here and then there was the dancing and the carrot and the apple and one of them jumped in my mouth and I don't know how I feel about that. But you know it was good I guess, so... ...I don't know where I'm supposed to go now, but the cupcake, I think it was sweet, I don't know if it's still going to be OK --  It's OK, Bowl-- I'm just trying to figure this out, Bowl, why do you sound like -- Why aren't you a bowl-- Wha -- What? Oh I -- there was this -- I -- you... No, it's OK. I'm gonna. I'm... I'm gonna just... sit... I don't know if the mushrooms can hear us. So, let's try to keep it down, okay? Did the teacup talk to you? Is there any carrots in that room? How about apples? The apples were pretty mean. Are there any bowls? Did you look in the drawers, because they can open the drawers themselves... Maybe I'll... make some fairy cakes. Is it possible I had some *bad* fairy cakes...? I will... never forget what I learned here today, let me be certain of that in my telling you things. You think you can talk to me that way, flower? Well, let me show you what happens to a flower who talks back. Hozzah! Fairy cake! Ha ha ha! Yes, Snegal, perfect timing! Could you perchance fetch me the fairy dust from the third drawer to the left on the second side of the upside up there. And while I wait for you I'm going to go look out his window and... Hey, what happened to that flower that was there earlier? Huh. Excellent, Snegal! That is... not at all what I asked for but will work just fine. We will do a spicy fairy cake! And perhaps this one will also help clear the sinuses, while bringing love to others. Now Snegal, would you like to see the magical step of infusing it with love? I'm glad that we are in a world where we all agree and add on to the last thought to help build the story, Snegal! Blat has not yet experienced a fairy cake. Though I imagine that Blat would like one should his bazooka, uh, happen to backfire. OK, well, if we're making one for Blat, let's get the chili flakes down from the second shelf on the left in the inside of the cupboard to the right. Excellent. And Mr. Sugar Cup! How are you today? Excellent, Mr. Sugar Cup! I don't know why all of you stopped talking to me after I spent those days in the book. But it's just as well, I prefer to be the one talking sometimes. Thank you for the... chili flakes. This pleather butter will do quite well for the treats for Blat. And we will put it in the bowl--how are you Mr. Bowl? I haven't heard from you in a few days either... No Mr. Bowl is my friend here who once talked to me quite extensively, and he sounded like he had had a few fairy cakes but when I tried to *show* people that Mr. Bowl would talk to me he stopped talking to me. And I think maybe I offended him when I called him Mr. Bowl, because maybe he's a Mrs. Bowl or a "they" Bowl. I don't know, I... Yes. We're making the fairy cake for Blat. So what we do is we put all of these ingredients--the pleather butter, which looks sort of like chili flakes in some way, and we put that in with the cracked corn, which looks sort of like the fairy dust... We add the flour. And what was that sound from outside? Excellent. Right. So we will go back to making the fairy cake. And we add flour, and then -- close your eyes. Close your eyes. Now we say: "We love everyone and want everyone to be happy." And we stick it in the oven for 43 minutes and 72 seconds. It's kind of a fairy -- I appear to not be wearing pants... But more concerning, my pouch is missing. I don't remember taking my -- I -- OK, I had a pouch and I don't have the pouch now, but the pouch has my fairy cakes. And I think there's a special connection now, because the fairy cakes always -- Well, I... I do imbue my fairy cakes with love and-- Wait, wait, I can see the pants over there by the doorway, so... I'm gonna go over there, could you -- I'm going to bend down and pick them up. Could you turn around, please? I mean, I'm -- Are you turned around? Are you turned around? I'm going to bend over and pick them up. Don't look over. Don't look over. OK. You can look now. I don't know. I was wearing pants before. I was also wearing my pouch before. Now I don't have my pouch and my pouch is very important to me because it has all the fairy cakes -- I make the best pleather cheesecake in all of Balgoria! All right. Now, you may see some dancing sugar, so I don't want you to be alarmed when that happens. OK. OK. Pleather cheesecake! I had a few leftover from an earlier recipe. That's... that's impressive in itself. I don't know if you know this, but your necklace has gotten kind of bright and it is starting to cause sunburns on my skin... my rosy cheeks are turning a little dark, and it's hurting and cracking now... Aaaaa it's a bright light... You shove a huge piece of pleather cheesecake into your mouth and swallow it without chewing? Yes, I saw that... No, you did that and I'm pretty sure I remember another woman doing that at the same time because it was, you know... I think you may have unhinged your jaw a little bit... It's clicking a bit as you talk. But we need -- we need to get my fairy pouch. He's got it! He's got it! OK, I'm gonna... Why are these bunnies over here saying "What are we going to have for dinner now," Blat? I think I'll hold on to that pouch for now. Water... please... Now is officially the time to panic -- I'm in charge! Aaaaa! I think it has very pretty legs. Aww, she called us friends. Why are we moving? Why is it a chicken? Does this chicken house that is running have seatbelts, Ananka? I don't feel very safe, because it's kind of jumping back and forth and the floor is uneven and there's, you know, hard edges on things that I feel like I'm going to fall on... Thanks. I lean down and give Darcy some of the hay I picked from the bed. How is it supposed to hurt? You're welcome. I will also exit the chicken house. I walk up and start petting the chicken house. See, everybody? It's a nice chicken house. It likes to be pet. Hey Blat! Come pet the house. It's okay! It won't bite you. Well, it might bite you. I don't know anything about it. But I'm petting it and it's not biting me. Fine. Let's go then. What does it mean by "Final"? Oh, that sounds nice. So, do you think they have, like, drinks and food? Hello? Anybody here in this creepy deserted bar? I've got my fairy cakes if we need them. Do you have any Impescor fizzy water? Okay, I'll just have regular water. Thank you. You never know. Maybe the Emperor also came back in time and set up his lovely Impescor brand that we all have come to appreciate so much. I'm Eggerton. What pieces fell off and why are they hard to get past? It is my first time to see the Oracle! Where I come from we don't really have oracles and, well, it's been a long time. It is a really long time -- there were zombies and the house with chicken legs and Blat had his bazooka and then he had another bazooka and it went on really long and he was saying there's no Impescor -- Oh, thank you very much sir. I like raccoons. Oh, hello, raccoon. I'll go find him. What... what? There's a hand! I have questions to ask, everybody. First, did anyone else see the hand? Second... why was there a giant hand? And why did it grab me like that? Third, really, did everyone else see it? Because I think that I may have had fairy cakes and forgot about it? That happens sometimes, I'm a nervous eater -- so if someone could please explain what the hand was, I would appreciate that. Raccoon, my little friend, he left me to the hand; he did not want to get involved and now I'm out here. It's a little disconcerting... I... I just wish I could... oh no. Oh no. I'm going to sit down here. You could have just asked. Okay. Like zombies? Mostly zombies. What is, per se, the Slaad? Are they friendly? Well, I always like to make new friends. We should go see them. Fine. Thanks, Ananka! I'll take the first watch! Yeah, what? I am defending our homestead against the forces of evil. I... there's no evil, so... you're welcome. I thought it was very nice. Not everything. It was his back, and he was trying to eat Blat alive? So I don't feel like you should probably judge me for that. And I did feel pretty bad about it. No, I think they're just a dark brown. I'm going to go in for a closer look. Yes, you are, and... What color would you call your eyes right now, kind sir? They're just brown, everybody. It's okay. We have a brown-eye situation. Joe, is that you? It's Joe, he says, but I don't know if we can trust him. She was dead. But she was dead yesterday, yes. Blat, you should come she went through overnight cleaning crew did. It's pretty impressive. What do you mean, "once again"? I too would like extra chocolate. Oh! Thank You. I like cakes. Wha ah you hahe...? So good... Hee hee! Did anyone else notice it get really dark just now? Oh, they're very good cakes. But it got dark and it's light outside, so I don't know why it would get dark like that -- Uh... Yeah? What? Okay. I'm just trying to solve the mystery of the dark room. What? Oh, fine! I'm going to sit and eat -- Awww... I -- That's the dark room thing I was talking about before. Clearly. What happened to Roderick, the raccoon I met? He was very friendly and then these hands came and took me away and I couldn't play with him anymore. Thank you. Could I have some more chocolate to go with my -- Okay. One of them sky chariots are outside. Hi, Chicken Hut! Who are you? I still have questions... Why -- Ohh. Why is everyone looking at me like that? Uh... Okay... I'll go with Blat and Darcy, because they've got bazookas and... I'll go with them. It's okay! With me in charge. Nothing bad could possibly happen. Let's go forth, Teeeam Fairy! Don't forget about Joe. He seemed pretty nice. Hey Blat. Which came first, the chicken house or Ananka? Maybe it was just an egg apartment. So, about the artifact… What what exactly are we talking about? Are these books important? Okay, Scribbles, away from the books. Let's go in this direction. Follow the fairy cakes, Scribbles! Yum yum yum! Come over here... Slow down! Water, please... Slow down. Water. Please... You need fairy cakes for the desert... because it sounds kind of like dessert. Okay! Why are they sitting down in the middle of the road? Do you want to continue our game of Candy World? I've got the board game in my bag. All right. I had three green goojubes and you had seven. Well, no. For every eight greens that you have, you can get one red, and if you get ten red you can get one purple swirly, and whoever has the most purple swirlys in the end wins. No, it means you're in the lead *for now,* but you never know what happens when we go around Fluff Top Mountain. See it's here on the board, next to the Sea of... ...and if you get more than ten, you get to go ahead and collect three reds. But if you only roll a 6 then you get two greens. And when you add all of those up at the end of the session we redistribute, and ultimately if you have all of the purple swirlys, then you win -- but first we have to get around the mountain, so you go ahead and roll. The dice only go up to 12... What? Oh, yeah yeah. Now, let me look at your aura. Yeah ok. I think you're kind of an orange person, so I'm going to pull out one of these special orange-icing ones. Here you go. And if you just take that... and I'd say eat half now, and maybe half in about an hour? But don't eat all of it at once. You're welcome. Go ahead. I'd like to see you eat it, though. Uh-oh... the fairy cake went bad. This happens sometimes. Now, everyone just stay calm. Now, listen to my voice. Everything's going to be okay. You sit down, maybe think about a nice story from your childhood. Focus on that. We'll keep everything nice and calm and quiet for you until this passes -- it's totally normal, it happens to some of us sometimes. Okay, I'll go get Darcy. No... I'll... I'll not go. Who's outside? Darcy, are you outside? Uh-oh. Blat, you should go check on the wind. The what? No, what? Wait. Okay. Now is officially the time to panic; I'm in charge. Everybody, stand up. And we're going to start shaking a little bit. I'm going to cry. It's okay though, because everything is not okay, and that's what we do when things aren't okay! We cry, because it lets out all of the sad... Oh no...! *Aaaaa!* I got... I got a fairy cake! All right. Got her! Fairy cakes are the greatest invention ever! You know, I don't even know why we're bothering with all of these medallions and beetles and stuff. We'll just bake a big batch of fairy cakes -- -- we'll go find the Shattering... Because your eyes are black. Because I threw the fairy cake. And it worked! Wait, I have a question. Can you say "There you all are"? Yeah, that wasn't the light. Towards the darkness it is. Hey, Ananka. I read stories about these creatures that used to chase fairies called Snufflesaurs. And I'm wondering if maybe Snufflesaurs are out in this desert? I wasn't too clear on where they are, but I feel kind of exposed back here and I can hear things. And you know there was the black eyes and everything. So, is that something, you know, like I need to be looking for? should I carry a stick or a bell or some kind to frighten them off? O... okay. Can we keep the lantern on for a little while? Okay. No, the rocks make more of a tumble sound -- that's a shuffle sound. And I left my Shuffler at home. I personally like my brains the way they are. And last time, they said they wanted brains and I wasn't okay with that, so *I* think that someone should probably go ask the zombie to go away and play with a snufflesaur. Okay! So I'm going to go over to this side of the tent now, away from the bumping and I, um, Blat, Blat, Blat, Blat, I think you should probably, you know, go play bazooka with the zombie. I need to get a stone like that. You go girl. I really need to get one of those stones. Okay. Good thing I didn't eat those ones. *Blat!* *Aaaaa!* *Run away!* I'm free! Get out! Come towards my voice! Next time, can we stay at a hotel? I lost my pillow. Ow! The stone of Fae… Long live Boltius. Of course we are, we’re still in Balgomar, we’re just in the Old Timey Park. Long live Boltius! You guys see how pretty it is outside, though? No, she said the world *did* cease to exist, but then we came back. Well, I've got my fairy cakes. That helps. You want a fairy cake? Why don't you start with a half? They're pretty strong. Yeah. OK. Thank you. Thank you. Why, thank you! I do. And I infuse all of them with a little bit of love. I'm glad. Let's hug it out. OK. There it is. OK, OK. OK, that's, that's... OK... OK. Good stuff. Is that a bit of a sandwich? Where'd you get that? It seems that the fairy cakes may have taken her down a dark path. Yes. Yes. Good night. Maybe you should go help your little friend. Hello there. Do you have any Impescor Original? Hello! I'm right here. Down. Down. You have... You're up high. Look down. Could I get an Impresco, plain please? Oh! that's all -- no, I got it. We're good. We're OK. Um, this this toast I'll enjoy the toast. I've not had toast in a long time. I don't think I've ever had toast. But do you perhaps have any Impresco? You know I'll take Zesty -- Yeah. This this is not Impresco. This is toast. I believe that this is in fact bread that has been heated. OK. Well, thank you very much for the Impresco, it's very kind of you and I look forward to sampling it. I'm going... I'm going to go sit with my friend and eat it. Well we've not known each other too long but I like to think we're -- Oh, I got that one too! You're quick, but I'm pretty quick too. Oh. OK. I don't think he's all that evil, I think he's maybe just a little cranky, not much of a morning person. He was mumbling something about files and a furnace in his sleep. But I'm sure that he wants to be your friend too. He does seem very, very kind. His name is Blat, by the way. Blat. Blat. Yes, yes Blat. Blat, just like that. Blat. But only one at a time. Just... just the one. OK. I'm going to go eat this now, thank you! What flavours of soup? I never really like having Zesty in the morning. Original tends has to be my go-to. But that -- Very pretty. I have a question. What was your name? Thank you, Zieffe. I... Uh... OK. All right, thank you. That is correct, sir. Neat! OK! ...and you know, I was never very good at drawing, but I thought that it was something I should probably practice anyway, and you'll see sometimes in my notebooks if you go through the little sketches of things, mostly it's the buildings -- Hi Zieffe! OK. Uh oh. I have a question! OW! Why? Why, why is this a thing? I have a question! OW! Why? Why are you doing this? Why would you do more?! I don't want to get hit! It hurts when I get hit! OK... Which candle would that be? I don't think you have our best interests at heart right now, sir. Oh... OK. Oh that's... Why? OK, OK, OK. Raptor. Gold. We never learned metric, darn it! Could I have a bandage, please? I, I -- Blat? Blat, I'm, I'm feeling a bit better, but I'm... Blat, is that you? Blat? What are these big leathery things? It's very soft, but warm, too -- Sorry, sorry. I've just never felt something so luxurious. I mixed the fairy cake with the potion the healer gave me. And you know, sometimes when you ride the bull, you get thrown off. What hurts so much? Did you get shot a bunch? I can't see your feet. I can't see. I only get one book? Everyone else gets... But you know I only need one book, because it's a better book. No, I cannot. I think the books are broken. There's no such thing as a magic word. They're glowing! OK, what what was it what that was was the word? Ego... Plebium! The large explosion ... was a celebration.  Ow! What was that? It smells kind of funny. Whaaa... What, what's going on? What? What? What? Ow! Did I get kicked several times? The minotaur? What minotaur? There's a minotaur? I was giving a presententation. It was an excellent presentation I was giving, and then I was eating cakes and then there was a pokey. And now... Now you're kick... Why is a minotaur kicking me? I would have thought they kick harder than that. Well, thank heavens for that. Who, who are you? Why, why... why is it dark? Why am I in a bag? I don't like being in bags. OK. The stone of Fae... What? I'm not dramatic. I don't think that was me. This stone is a very nice stone, wouldn't you say? But I'm already standing. Steal? How do I steal myself I already am myself? I don't want badness. It's actually a very nice field though, I quite like this stone... ...And it shines and I feel kind of loving... Who was wearing a hat? I don't remember. I was giving a presentation and I was *nailing* the presentation, because you see, there was this extremely devastating explosion. ...less bad, add an exclamation point to it, and then it's... Yes, to the explosion. So it's, "We're all going to be OK!" And then there was a lot of bodies but the bodies... I think I had cahoots as a child. They were a very tasty. I remember them being kind of purple with sprinkles on them. I'm not too sure if I've ever made them before I could probably try... Well, hello everybody. It's so nice of you to come out and see me. My name's Eggerton and I like to talk about the news and I come up with ideas for the Committee of State to help them find better ways to tell things to people. Yes, yes, yes?  We are not aware of any such explosion that may or may not have taken place somewhere around this explosion site. If you could just step aside, sorry, the paramedics are coming through to take away that body. We're still gathering facts and we really don't want to send anyone into a panic.  "Extreme risk" is really strong words. I have no evidence to suggest that there absolutely will be a second explosion... and really anything can explode at any time so there's no reason to think that another explosion would take place here. I mean that's like saying that, I don't know, a minotaur travels through time. It's just not likely.  The best thing to do when you're feeling worried is to eat fairy cakes. But if you don't happen to have any, you can go ahead and send positive vibes out into the world. So if for instance you're listening to a podcast right now, you can leave a very positive review and make sure you subscribe which realistically you probably should have done already.  It's very important to make sure our infrastructure, which was not necessarily damaged by an alleged explosion, stay intact. And if people do want to make sure that Balgomar can continue forward strongly they can support these efforts at patreon.com/AlbaSalix.  When you say several centuries in the past, do you mean like there is some special new park nearby where they have *made* it several centuries in the past?  Well see, there you go! It's just a nice park.  We came from this era?  That happens sometimes, you know where I'm from there's these explosions that happen every now and then and someone has to file them, I wouldn't want that job, but every now and then I have to talk about them and make sure that people know everything's OK even though these explosions keep happening. I'm pretty good at it actually. I think I might get a promotion from Karen and my coworkers...  What?  Long live Boltius!  Long live Boltius!  Long live Boltius!  The emperor isn't alive?  What did you do to him?  Long live Boltius!  Then how did he win the war?   Long live Boltius, centaur!  Long live Boltius!  Boltius!  See, he knows!  He said "Long live", and I think he said "Boltius" after that. I'm wet too! Long live Boltius!  Long live Boltius!  See?  No, she said it! She didn't even hesitate. She said it, she knows who Boltius is, she wants him to live long because she is a good Balgomarian just like I am. And I think that this proves everything that I've been saying. I don't know why you keep doubting all of this it seems pretty obvious that this is just a special park that has been set up like Old Timey Town so we can all explore what life was like, as hard as it was, before Boltius -- long live Boltius -- came along and won the war and made everything better for all of us.  I am Eggerton, and it's very nice to meet you. Who are you?  I don't know why you'd say something like that. My file probably isn't too short. I don't have a file that I know of but I do have a fairy pouch. My fairy pouch is always full of fairy treats because I spent a lot of time baking...  Long live Boltius!  See? I don't know why you keep doing this thing. It's pretty obvious to me though that's where we are is with Boltius because Balgomarians don't know...  Long live Boltius.  Of course we are, we're still in Balgomar, we're just in the Old Timey Park.  Long live Boltius! She's, she's, she's busy... She's not paying that much attention. She's probably staying in character.  Oh sorry, I'll sit down. Do you have a preference where I sit down because I find that I can't sit -- -- OK, I'll sit over there.  *O Boltius, you are great and wise* *And we thank you for being our Emperor* *And... other things --*
